# Magic methods (also called dunder methods because they have double underscores __ before and 
# after their names) are special methods in Python that allow objects to define their behavior in built-in operations 
# like arithmetic, comparisons, string representation, and more.
# Common Magic Methods:
# 1. Object Initialization & Representation
# __init__(self, ...) → Constructor, initializes an instance.
# __str__(self) → String representation for str(obj).
# __repr__(self) → String representation for debugging (repr(obj)).
# 2. Arithmetic Operations
# __add__(self, other) → Defines self + other.
# __sub__(self, other) → Defines self - other.
# __mul__(self, other) → Defines self * other.
# __truediv__(self, other) → Defines self / other.
# __floordiv__(self, other) → Defines self // other.
# __mod__(self, other) → Defines self % other.
# 3. Comparison Operators
# __eq__(self, other) → Defines self == other.
# __ne__(self, other) → Defines self != other.
# __lt__(self, other) → Defines self < other.
# __le__(self, other) → Defines self <= other.
# __gt__(self, other) → Defines self > other.
# __ge__(self, other) → Defines self >= other.
# 4. Attribute Access & Management
# __getattr__(self, name) → Defines behavior for accessing non-existent attributes.
# __setattr__(self, name, value) → Defines behavior for setting attributes.
# __delattr__(self, name) → Defines behavior for deleting attributes.
# 5. Container & Sequence Methods
# __len__(self) → Defines len(self).
# __getitem__(self, key) → Defines self[key].
# __setitem__(self, key, value) → Defines self[key] = value.
# __delitem__(self, key) → Defines del self[key].
# 6. Object Call & Iteration
# __call__(self, *args, **kwargs) → Allows an instance to be called like a function.
# __iter__(self) → Defines iteration behavior (for x in obj).
# __next__(self) → Defines next(obj).

# Example Usage:
# class Point:
#     def __init__(self, x, y):
#         self.x = x
#         self.y = y

#     def __add__(self, other):
#         return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

#     def __str__(self):
#         return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

# p1 = Point(2, 3)
# p2 = Point(4, 5)
# p3 = p1 + p2  # Calls __add__
# print(p3)     # Calls __str__: Output -> Point(6, 8)


# Getter and Setter Methods
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self._name = name
#         self._age = age
#    @property
#     def get_name(self):
#         return self._name
#     @name.setter
#     def set_name(self, name):
#         self._name = name
#     @property
#     def get_age(self):
#         return self._age
#     @age.setter
#     def set_age(self, age):
#         self._age = age
# student = Student("Alice", 20)
# print(student.get_name())  # Alice
# student.set_name("Bob")
# print(student.get_name())  # Bob
# print(student.get_age())  # 20
# student.set_age(25)
# print(student.get_age())  # 25


# Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully handle errors that may occur during program execution, preventing crashes and providing meaningful error messages.

# 1. What is an Exception?
# An exception is an error that occurs during program execution, stopping normal flow. Examples include:

# ZeroDivisionError: Division by zero.
# TypeError: Invalid operations between data types.
# FileNotFoundError: Accessing a missing file.


# 2. Handling Exceptions Using try-except
# Python provides the try-except block to catch and handle exceptions.

# try:
#     num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#     result = 10 / num
#     print("Result:", result)
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
# except ValueError:
#     print("Error: Please enter a valid number.")
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

# How it works:
# Code inside try runs normally.
# If an exception occurs, it jumps to except, handling the error.
# except Exception as e catches any unexpected errors.



# 3. Using finally for Cleanup
# The finally block always executes, even if an exception occurs. It is used for cleanup tasks like closing files or network connections.
# try:
#     file = open("data.txt", "r")
#     content = file.read()
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print("File not found.")
# finally:
#     print("Closing the file.")
#     file.close()


# 4. Raising Custom Exceptions (raise)
# You can manually raise exceptions using raise.

# def withdraw(amount):
#     if amount > 1000:
#         raise ValueError("Withdrawal limit exceeded!")
#     print(f"Withdrew {amount}")

# try:
#     withdraw(1500)
# except ValueError as e:
#     print(f"Transaction failed: {e}")


# 5. Custom Exception Classes
# You can define your own exception types by inheriting from Exception.

# class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
#     pass

# def withdraw(balance, amount):
#     if amount > balance:
#         raise InsufficientFundsError("Not enough funds.")
#     print(f"Withdrew {amount}")

# try:
#     withdraw(500, 1000)
# except InsufficientFundsError as e:
#     print(f"Error: {e}")
